Threre are 6 different colors for bubbles ...
... and it's starts out with an empty 9x9 grid
There are three colored bubbles on the grid at the start
The player can click on one of the bubbles ...
... and click on a square where you want the bubble to go
The bubble can only move there if there is a free path (bubbles can't move on diagonals)
After every player move the computer places 3 more random colored bubbles to random empty places on the board
If the player manages to get 5 or more bubbles of the same color in a row/column/diagonal they are removed from the field and the player earns points depending on how many there were removed.
After the player managed to get bubbles removed he can move a bubble again without the PC adding more bubbles beforehand.
If the whole board is full the game ends and the score is displayed and the player is ranked (e.g. bronze, silver, gold)
